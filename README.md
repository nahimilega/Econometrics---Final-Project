# Indias' GDP misestimation, Analysis through taxes.

We propose to perform an extensive econometric analysis of these claims and test whether tax data should
have been included or not included while testing the misestimation of the GDP of India.
The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) in its rebuttal 4 to Arvind Subramanian
paper 1 stated that :
“ Unlike many indicators, tax data is not collected through surveys or by agencies through arcane techniques,
these are hard numbers and should be an important indicator of growth. Further, there have been no major
changes in tax laws until the end period in the author’s analysis (31st March 2017). GST was introduced on
1st July 2017. The author’s logic of not using tax data appears to be a convenient argument meant to avoid
inconvenient conclusions based on hard facts  . ”
The EAC-PM raised concerns over the fact that  Arvind Subramanian didn’t include taxes in his study 1 , but as
stated, taxes are “ hard numbers and should be an important indicator of growth. ”  EAC-PM also argues that
the tax plays an essential role in the GDP growth rate of the country, and should be considered as one of the
fundamental indicators of growth of a country.
Therefore, we propose to perform an extensive econometric analysis of these claims and test whether tax
should have been included or not included while testing the misestimation of the GDP of India.
